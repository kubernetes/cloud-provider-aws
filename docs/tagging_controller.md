# The Tagging Controller

The tagging controller is responsible for tagging and untagging node resources when they join and leave the cluster, respectively. It can add and remove tags based on user input. Additionally, if a tag is updated, it would leave the updated tag and reapply the user-provided tag. Unlike the existing controllers, the tagging controller works exclusively with AWS. The AWS APIs it uses are `ec2:CreateTags` and `ec2:DeleteTags`.
