            AWS Cloud Provider

            The cloud provider now runs out-of-tree in a new component called aws-cloud-controller-manager.
            The external provider preserves all existing behavior/functionality from the legacy in-tree provider.

            Example manifests to deploy the external cloud provider can be found [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-aws/tree/master/manifests).

            ## CHANGELOG
            See [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-aws/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for full list of changes.
